    "In this task, my role is downloading the file and collation module.\n",
    "First, I wrote the (download_answer_files) function and uploaded the quiz_answers_named_a1_to_a25 folder to my school (University of Leeds) OneDrive account. However, I had some challenges as the code has some errors and the files could not be downloaded via the share links. Therefore, I did some research and discussing with my group members. Then, I found that I could change the link format by adding &download=1 at the end of each of the file links to convert them into correct download links. Also, the answer respondent data is successfully downloaded after fixing the code.\n",
    "To add on, I wrote the (collate_answer_files) function to generate a single file (collated_answers.txt) with an asterisk (*) separating the data from each respondent.\n"
